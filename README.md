# BOIDS
BOID System for Unity

Swarm Steering Behavious System for Unity.

## Features:
- Directional **Alignment** with neighbouring agents
- Positional **Cohesion** of Swarm
- **Seperation** to avoid clumping
- **Steering** towards a goal
- **Avoidance** of obstacles

Originally I made this for a Gama Jam. This is a slightly improved version in *3D* and with minor improvements.
